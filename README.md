Welcome to ***Atari 2600 Endless Runner: Spike Escape V2***! An enhancement of the original classic-style game, *Spike Escape*. The reminiscing of these retro games does not stop, and so does the endless running through the perilous road. This time youâ€™re not only met with just spikes, but also more obstacles to avoid from, be careful not to crash! Although along with the new obstacles comes with the new helpful power-ups and collectibles in-game. Collect coins to earn points, pick up the score multiplier to earn even more points! Pick up the Invincibility power-up that takes you to a sensation of power and recklessness, making you pass through obstacles with ease. Also introducing new sets of car models which you can choose. From cars, to iconic characters with different colors to play as while you dodge those pesky obstacles. So get ready, get set, buckle up, and escape (again)!
